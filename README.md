# UnityProjectBrowser
A standalone Winforms application for browsing references in a Unity project.

In the Unity Editor, it's often easy to see which assets and scripts are being used by a particular asset. However, it's much more difficult to see incoming references - which assets are *referencing* that asset. This program performs that function by parsing the entire contents of a Unity project and building a network of references you can browse.
